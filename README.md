# Decentralized Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Trading Platform

This project implements a decentralized platform for issuing, trading, and retiring Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

The platform consists of four main contracts:

1. REC Issuance Contract (`rec-issuance.clar`)
2. Trading Contract (`trading.clar`)
3. Compliance Tracking Contract (`compliance-tracking.clar`)
4. Retirement Contract (`retirement.clar`)

These contracts work together to create a comprehensive system for managing RECs in a decentralized manner.

## Contracts

### REC Issuance Contract

This contract handles the creation and management of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Key functions:
- `issue-certificate`: Creates a new REC for verified renewable energy production.
- `is-certificate-valid`: Checks if a certificate is valid and not expired.

### Trading Contract

This contract facilitates the buying and selling of RECs between parties.

Key functions:
- `create-sell-order`: Creates a new sell order for a REC.
- `fulfill-order`: Allows a buyer to purchase a REC by fulfilling an existing sell order.

### Compliance Tracking Contract

This contract monitors adherence to renewable energy mandates for various entities.

Key functions:
- `set-compliance-requirement`: Sets the required amount of renewable energy for an entity in a given year.
- `update-compliance`: Updates an entity's compliance status based on acquired RECs.
- `get-compliance-status`: Retrieves the current compliance status for an entity.

### Retirement Contract

This contract manages the permanent removal of used RECs from circulation.

Key functions:
- `retire-certificate`: Permanently retires a REC, removing it from circulation.
- `get-retirement-info`: Retrieves information about a retired REC.

## Usage

To use this platform, deploy the contracts to the Stacks blockchain and interact with them using a Stacks wallet or through API calls.

1. Issue RECs for verified renewable energy production.
2. Trade RECs on the open market.
3. Track compliance with renewable energy mandates.
4. Retire RECs after they've been used to meet compliance requirements.

## Development

To set up the development environment:

1. Install the Clarity CLI and other necessary tools.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Use the Clarity CLI to check, test, and deploy the contracts.

## Testing

Each contract should have corresponding test files to ensure proper functionality. Run these tests using the Clarity CLI or your preferred testing framework for Clarity smart contracts.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that only authorized entities can issue new RECs.
- Implement proper access control for compliance tracking and retirement functions.
- Regularly audit the contracts for potential vulnerabilities.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more sophisticated pricing mechanism for REC trading.
- Add support for different types of renewable energy sources.
- Integrate with real-world energy production data sources for automated REC issuance.
